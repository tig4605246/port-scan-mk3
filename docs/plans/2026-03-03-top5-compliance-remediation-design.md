# Top 5 Compliance Remediation Design

Date: 2026-03-03
Feature: 001-enhance-input-parser

## Goal
Fix the top 5 issues found in spec/plan/tasks analysis with minimal, concrete edits while preserving current story structure.

## Scope
1. Update spec to require parser-output + writer-output contract alignment.
2. Make SC-003 and SC-004 measurable with reproducible test dataset and calculation method.
3. Update tasks to include Go doc comments for public package behavior.
4. Update tasks to include explicit integration boundary coverage for parser/task/pipeline/writer.
5. Update tasks to enforce required e2e execution when scan pipeline or writer behavior is touched.

## Approach
- Apply focused edits to `specs/001-enhance-input-parser/spec.md` and `specs/001-enhance-input-parser/tasks.md`.
- Re-run `/speckit.tasks` workflow to regenerate executable tasks from latest plan/spec.
- Re-run `/speckit.analyze` in read-only mode to verify convergence.

## Validation
- No remaining CRITICAL constitution conflicts for the five target items.
- SC-003/SC-004 become objectively testable via documented dataset + formula + evidence location.
- tasks keep strict checklist format and include compliance gates.

## Out of Scope
- No architecture redesign.
- No code implementation changes in `pkg/*`.
